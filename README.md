## Introduction 
GasByGas, a leading LP gas distributor in Sri Lanka, operates a widespread network of registered 
outlet shops and service centers across all districts to facilitate island-wide gas distribution. To 
enhance efficiency and transparency in gas distribution and tracking, the company aims to implement 
an Online Gas Requesting and Delivery System. This system will enable end consumers to request 
gas from designated outlets, obtain a token with a defined pickup period, and receive notifications 
regarding delivery schedules. The platform will also enforce request limitations based on unique 
personal identifiers such as NIC, phone number, or email to prevent multiple registrations per identity. 

In cases where scheduled gas deliveries are unavailable or stocks are depleted, the system will 
promptly inform customers and restrict new requests. Additionally, the outlet managers will have the 
capability to verify consumer tokens, mark request statuses upon receiving empty cylinders and 
payments, and reallocate unclaimed requests to other customers through proper communication. The 
system will also cater to industrial and business gas requests separately, ensuring validation through 
organizational certification. A centralized web server with a database will serve as the core 
infrastructure, supporting both a web application for client uses and a mobile application that 
integrates with the same services. The head office will have access to real-time insights into outlet 
statuses, enabling better decision-making regarding distribution management. Through this digital 
transformation, GasByGas aims to streamline operations, enhance customer convenience, and 
optimize resource allocation within its distribution network.
